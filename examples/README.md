# Code Samples and Examples of Proxizing Mechanisms and Protocols

This folder contains implementation examples for ProxyTyper's mechanisms. These are intended for several purposes:
<ol>
<li> provide the basic code samples that users can experiment with,
<li> familiarize users with the mechanisms and the related tuning parameters,
<li> familiarize users with the scripting logic, coding patterns to efficiently build panel *proxizing* pipelines,
<li> provide self-contained and simple testing scenarios that users can test the pipelines on a single script.
</ol>

We start from the basics of describing the genotype imputation outsourving scenario and motivating ProxyTyper's panel "proxizing" pipeline approach. We review all mechanisms and related parameters. 

We recommend reviewing these folders in order since we tried to order these examples from simplest to more complex. The examples, however, do not depend on each other and can also be explored in any order (obviously!).
